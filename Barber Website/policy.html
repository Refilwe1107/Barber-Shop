        In order to respect the time of both our clients and our staff, we ask
        you to arrive on time for your appointment. Clients arriving more than
        15 minutes late, will be imposed with a R100 fee and clients arriving
        more than 30 minutes late will forfeit the original appointment and be

        appointment, we simply ask that you notify us of any cancellations or
        reschedulings at least 24 hours prior to the appointment. If the booking
        was made on the same day, notify us at least 3 hours prior.
        Cancellations that break these rules will cause a R20 fee added to your
        next appointment.
